# Neo-sex chromosome in _Melanargia ines_

**This repository is not up-to-date. Will update asap!**

This repository contains codes and scripts used for the report "Rewinding the ratchet: rare recombination locally rescues neo-W degeneration and generates plateaus of sex-chromosome divergence"

Analyses are described in the following markdown files: 

- [Variant callaning and filtering](variant_calling_and_filtering.md)

- [Estimation of diversity and divergence](diversity_divergence.md)

- [PCA, and demographic inference using gIMble](pca_gIMble.md)

- [Phylogenetic tree construction and topology testing](phylogenetic_trees.md)

- [Neo-sex chromosome phasing](neosex_phasing.md)

- [Gene expression analysis](gene_expression.md)

- [High-impact mutations, purifying selection and K_0 / K_4](high_impact_purifying_K0_K4.md)


The code for figures created in R are found in the [figure.qmd](figures.qmd) quarto document.
