TO DO
- MULTICALLABLE BED
- FASTQ

This repository contains codes and scripts used for the report "Neo-W degradation locally reversed by rare recombination events in the Spanish marbled white"

Analyses are described in the following markdown files: 

- [Variant callaning and filtering](variant_calling_and_filtering.md)

- [Principal Component Analysis](PCA.md)

- [Estimation of diversity and divergence](diversity_divergence.md)

- [Demographic inference using gIMble and PSMC](gIMble.md)

- [Phylogenetic tree construction](trees.md)

- [Change point analysis](change_point.md)

- [Neo-sex chromosome phasing](neosex_phasing.md)

- [Single tree test](variant_types.md)

- [Gene expression analysis](gene_expression.md)

- [Loss-of-function mutations](lof.md)


The codes to create the figures found in the manuscript are in the [neosex_figures.qmd](neosex_figures.qmd) quarto document.
